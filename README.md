# Genetic Algorithm Implementation in C#

This repository contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in C#. The Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It is commonly used in optimization and search problems, including test data generation in software testing.

## Features

- Initialization of a population with random chromosomes
- Selection methods for choosing chromosomes based on fitness
- Crossover methods for generating offspring by combining genetic information
- Mutation operations to introduce diversity into the population
- Update population method to maintain diverse solutions
- Analysis methods for evaluating population performance

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
3. Modify the parameters in the `Program.cs` file to configure the Genetic Algorithm.
4. Build and run the program to execute the Genetic Algorithm with the specified parameters.
5. View the console output for progress updates and analysis results.

## Configuration

You can customize the Genetic Algorithm by modifying the parameters in the `Program.cs` file:
- Population size
- Number of generations
- Generation gap
- Selection method
- Crossover method
- Crossover probability
- Mutation probability
- Chromosome type
- Chromosome size
- Allele base
- Allele range

## Analysis

The Genetic Algorithm implementation includes analysis methods such as:
- Average fitness calculation
- Best chromosome identification
- Top N chromosomes retrieval

You can use these analysis methods to evaluate the performance of the Genetic Algorithm during execution.
